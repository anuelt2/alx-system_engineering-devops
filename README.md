# First Shell Scripting Project

Welcome to my first approach to systems engineering and devops with a focus  on scripting and bash. ALX software engineering program.

## Description

- This repository contains a collection of simple Bash scripts that form part of my learning journey as a full-stack software engineering student.
- These Bash scripts perform a few basic tasks, with the goal of learning and gaining fundamental knowledge of essentials of shell scripting.
- The primary goal is to demonstrate my grasp of shell scripting concepts and build a foundation for more complex scripts in the future.
