# First Shell Redirections Project

Welcome to my first approach to learning about shell redirections. This directory contains a series of tasks that are designed to help me understand and practice shell redirections. I am doing this on Linux Ubuntu 24.04. (ALXSE uses Ubuntu 20.04 as the environment for evaluations).

## Tasks
